  	      Nazis encouraged the systematic persecution of Jews, gays, romanies, Jehovah's Witnesses, socialists and anyone who did not look like them. Once the Nazis learnt to dehumanise these groups, they were able to treat these groups like animals.

  	      Having learnt how to treat humans as animals, the Nazis were no longer inhibited from respecting the rights of those humans. First, they raped the Jews' right to work. Then stole their property, before they finally instigated the greatest crime of all, denying their right to live

  	      Until they were fighting nearly every country in the world. Thus the Nazis' racism had led to the worst genocide in human history, and their nationalism led to the most destructive war in the history of the world.
